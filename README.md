# IID4constancy
Code from the study "Deep neural networks trained for estimating albedo and illumination solve lightness constancy differently than human observers."

The directory is organized in three sub-directories: The directory "renderings" containing the code we used to generate our datasets; The directory "training" with the code we used to train our models; One directory "Analysis" that includes the code used for the analysis and figures incorporated in the paper.
